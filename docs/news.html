                    15th August 2025:<br> <br>
                    New game!! Crate Chaos. Crate Chaos is a simple,<br> 
                    chaotic little game where you’re just trying to reach a ladder<br>
                    — but of course, there’s a pile of crates in the way.<br>
                    You’ve only got one lever, and it controls a crusher.<br>
                    The goal is to figure out the right timing and rhythm to crush the<br>
                    crates in front of you, one by one, clearing a path so you can climb<br>
                    the ladder and move on. The crates don’t fall or move — <br>
                    they’re just sitting there, blocking you. So it’s all about using the lever<br>
                    at the right moment to activate the crusher, clear a crate, and step forward.<br>
                    It’s part puzzle, part timing, and super satisfying when you crush<br>
                    that last crate and reach the ladder. Simple setup, one lever,<br>
                    and a whole lot of crate-smashing fun.<br>  
                </p>

                    endless waves of marching alien invaders. They creep from side to side,<br>
                    inching closer with every step, and it’s up to you to stop them before<br>
                    Earth is toast! Duck behind shields, time your shots, and aim for that<br>
                    sneaky bonus UFO that zips by for extra points. As the aliens drop,<br>
